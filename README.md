# TicketLight - sample app for managing a ticket resource 


### .NET API

The API was developed using VS Community for Mac. 
It uses a local db file (sqlite). To view the containing data DB Browser for Sqlite can be used.

Open the VS solution located at /api/TicketLight and run it. 
It should open up a browser window with the url https://localhost:5001/api/tickets


### Angular Client

Open client/ticket-light-client (root client folder)

Run 
```
npm install
```
to install missing node modules.

Run 
```
npm start
```
to start the client.

Open up a browser window and hit http://localhost:4200/

If everything works smoothy, some tickets will appear after hitting the search button.
